Virtualization : -means creating a virtual version of something(desktop,server,storage,network)
                 It is a technique that allows to share simgle physical instance or resource among multiple organizations or customers.
                 All virtual servers will work independently
                 It allows u to create multiple instances from single physical instance.
Host Machine: It is a machine on which virtual machine is going to be build
Guest Machine:It is  a created virtual machine.
Hyperviser: It is a software that creates and runs the virtual machines.
            It is used to create virtualization on physical machines
2 main types of virtualization
Type 1:Native/bare metal virtualization
        In Type 1 virtualization (bare-metal virtualization), the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical hardware of the host machine, without requiring an underlying operating system.
Type 2:Hosted virtualization 
        In Type 2 virtualization, the hypervisor is installed on top of an existing operating system, which means it's not directly interacting with the physical hardware. 

In aws, softwares used for hypervisor are "xen" and "Nitro". 
Xen is used for old machine type families like t2 micro family
Nitro is used for latest instance types

**Benefits of Virtualization**
-lowers the cost of It Infrastructure
-Remote access
-Better resource utilization
-pay per use of IT infrastructure on demand
