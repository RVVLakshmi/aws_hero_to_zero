Scenario Based Practice Question For IAM Role.
Problem Statement: You are tasked with setting up and configuring AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for a new web application that your company is developing. The goal is to ensure that the AWS environment is secure, and that users, roles, and policies are appropriately allocated to meet the specific requirements of the application.

This is how i approach this problem.
 Created Two User Groups
 Developers
 Operators
 Attached some policies to developer that allow developer to do their task from their aws user account.
 Ec2 full access
 Rds full access
 Route 53 full access
 SQS full access
 Cloudformation full access
 Code build full access
 Code commit full access
 Code deployer full access
 Lambda function full access
 Attached some policies to operators that will allow them to see logs, metrics, resources configuration and other information.
 Ec2 read only
 Rds read only
 Route 53 read only
 Sqs read only
 Cloud watch access
 Then i created three users.
 Alice - developer
 Charlie - developer
 Bob - Operator
 Then i created IAM role for ec2 instance named WebAppEC2Role
 This role ensures that ec2 instance will have enough permission to access other aws services that developer will need from his aws account.
